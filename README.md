# üé¨ Movie Data Engineering ETL Pipeline

## üìñ Overview
This project implements a **Movie ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Pipeline** using **Python, Pandas, SQLite, and Flask**.  
It extracts raw movie data from a CSV file, transforms it into structured tables, loads it into a database, and displays the results through a simple web dashboard.

The goal is to simulate a **real-world data engineering workflow**, from raw data ingestion to data visualization and validation.
